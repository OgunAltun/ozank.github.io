[EEE STAR](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/) program is created to provide EEE undergraduate students an opportunity to be a part of the various research groups in the department and conduct cutting-edge research, whether you join an established research group and contribute to the work, or pursue your own ideas.

For more information please visit the [official project webpage](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/).

Here are a few projects that I offer this year:

If you are planning to choose one of these projects, please come and visit me to ask any questions and clarify your mind.

## 1- A smart Power Supply for Raspberry Pi:
The aim of this project is to design an efficient DC-DC converter that can supply a [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/). There will be communication between Rasp-pi and power supply so that thus features like auto shut-down, low-power mode will be possible.

**What you will learn:** Design of a DC-DC power supply, PCB design and manufacturing. It is also possible to commercialize your product.

## 2- Design of a Tethered Quad-copter for Continuous Flying:

Flying time of [quad-copters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadcopter) is limited to 10-15 minutes due to battery capacity. Although, a ground powered quad-copter can fly continuously and perform its mission (ie image processing, continuous video recording) for extended periods. In this project, you will design a power supply and transmission cable for a ground powered quad-copter. The aim is to minimize the mass of the transmission wire, thus it is necessary to design a step-up power converter (ie. use thinner wire using high-voltage, low current).

**What you will learn:** Design of a step-up, step-down power supply. How to handle the harmonics in a long transmission cable. Optimization algorithms to choose the best design parameters.


## 3- Design of a Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle(UAV) for HV Transmission Line Inspections:

Inspection of a HV transmission line is expensive and time consuming. In this project, you will investigate the possibility of using an UAV to fly over transmission lines. The main idea of the project is to use the electromagnetic field distribution around the HV cables to position and navigate the UAV autonomously.

**What you will learn:** Electromagnetic distribution around transmission lines, use of a finite-element software, design and manufacture a magnetic field sensor.

## 4- A smart phone application for condition monitoring for electric machines:

Unexpected faults in electric machines in industry can cause long down-times and result in high costs. A smart phone application can be used as a portable condition-monitoring device for electric machines. The vibration and acoustic signal can be captured and analysed and any anomalies in the machine can be detected before a serious break-down. A successful app has the potential to be commercialized through Apple Store and Google Market.

**What you will learn:** Harmonics in an electric machine, signal processing, and how to write a mobile phone application.

## 5- Design of an Open-source FEA Toolbox for Electric Machine Optimization

There are many commercial electric machine design software, but there are only a few open-source and non-profit software in this area. The aim of the project is to combine all these small codes and software into a single toolbox that can be used freely by researchers around the world.

**What you will learn:** developing an open-source project, Python  and Octave coding and learn how to use a version control system (eg Git).


## 6- Design of an Open-source FEA Optimization tool for Amazon Cloud Computing ([Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/))

Similar to previous project, but this project focusses on running a open-source FEA program on a cloud computer cluster. Thus, time consuming FEA optimization problems can be run in parallel and the optimum design can be achieved in a very short amount of time without the need of setting up expensive work-stations.

**What you will learn:** How to work with Linux machines, cloud computing, genetic algorithm optimization.

## 7- Design of an electric bike motor drive with no battery.

There are many types of electric bikes in the market, but all of them have bulky and expensive batteries with ranges up to 15-20 km. In this project, a small super capacitor will be used instead of a battery, which will be charged by regenerative braking when going down-hill. The charged capacitor will be used to assist the cyclist when going up-hill.

**What you will learn:** Control of Brushless DC motors. Design of a motor drive controller with regenerative braking. System and PCB design of the motor drive.

## 8- Design of a micro single-phase induction motor

Mechanical Electricity-meter use [single-phase induction motor](http://electrical-engineering-portal.com/overview-of-single-phase-induction-type-energy-meter). The same design can be used as a micro-motor because of its simple structure and robustness. The project will be more hands-on approach to modify the design for micro-manufacturing techniques.

**What you will learn:** Design of electric machines, manufacturing techniques for micro-systems. A successful project has the chance to continue as a funded MSc project.
