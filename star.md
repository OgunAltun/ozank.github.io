[EEE STAR](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/) program is created to provide EEE undergraduate students an opportunity to be a part of the various research groups in the department and conduct cutting-edge research, whether you join an established research group and contribute to the work, or pursue your own ideas.

For more information please visit the [official project webpage](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/).

Here are a few projects that I offer this year:

If you are planning to choose one of these projects, please feel free to  come and visit me or Mesut Ugur to ask any questions. Then please fill the application form using this link: [http://goo.gl/forms/OCBGSDv0tL](http://goo.gl/forms/OCBGSDv0tL), so I can keep a track of applied students.

## 1. Finite element analysis of a permanent magnet electrical machine using Ansys/Maxwell
