## Brief Info:

This course covers basic operating characteristics and classification of electrical drives, solid-state DC and AC motor control, dynamic behaviour of electrical machines, selection of drives for various industrial applications. You will find chance to design and implement motor drive systems for realistic applications throughout term projects. There will be an optional hardware motor drive project which uses HIL (hardware-in-the-loop).

## Important Notes:

In this course there are no midterms, but you are going to do three projects, covering most of the semester. Therefore, I expect you to spend considerable amount of time on projects and discussing your results in the classroom. There will be a final exam, which will be open-book. 

In this course I will apply [learning by doing](http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/lockers/users/f/felder/public/Columns/Active.pdf), thus I expect (and encourage) you to actively participate to the lectures. Here are the important points:

- There are no stupid questions.
- Even if there is, asking a stupid question doesn't mean that you are stupid.
- Studying is an activity of students, not of lecturers.


## Course Objectives:

At the end of course you will be able to:

- Understand the fundamental principles of motor drives and the mechanical systems.
- Analyse and design DC/AC motor drives (including power stage and control loops).
- Select motor drive systems for various industrial applications
- Use multi-domain simulation software (e.g. [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html), [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org/))
- Prepare design reports and use version control system ([GitHub](https://github.com/))
to build your online portfolio.
- Use commercial industrial motor drive systems through laboratory, and use [hardware-in-the-loop](https://www.mathworks.com/hardware-support/ti-c2000.html) systems by an optional design project.

## Grading:

- 1st Project: 10%
- 2nd Project: 15%

## Notes on Projects

- I would like you to use a [version control system](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) for your project. Please check [keysan.me/okst/](http://keysan.me/okst/) for details.

- You will submit your projects using [GitHub](https://github.com/), so please open an account (preferably with your real name, as it will be your online portfolio), and complete a few tutorials and learn the basics as soon as possible.

- You will not only submit the latest version of your projects, but I would like to see the intermediate stages, and you'll be also graded with number of commits, so please start working on projects in the early days.

- For simulations I advise you to use MATLAB [Simulink](https://www.mathworks.com/products/simulink.html), but [Modelica](https://www.modelica.org/) is also a good (and open-source) alternative. If you haven't used MATLAB/Simulink before, set it up and start learning it as soon as possible.

- You are required to present your projects with a report. Although, I don't reinforce it, I strongly recommend [Simulink Report Generator](https://www.mathworks.com/help/rptgenext/). You have to invest some time at the beginning, but it will definitely pay-off later.

### Projects Grading

**Number of Commits:25%:** The number of edits of your project files as seen from the contributors list. For example, if you start making your project in the last few days, you'll get no credit. If you start early and continue editing your files, you'll get full credit. The project topics are not easy, so this is a way to encourage  you to start early and work regularly.

**Level of Information:50%:** The detail level of your designs (see requirements above), and the accuracy of your calculations.

**Report Quality:25%:** Text explaining your design decisions, quality of your figures, citing relevant studies and your conclusion section.
