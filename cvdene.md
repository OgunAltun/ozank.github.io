Research Interests
==================

My main area of interest is in the design and development of electrical
machines. In particular, I am working on novel machine topologies such
as superconducting machines and permanent-magnet machines. I also worked
on the structural and thermal analysis of electrical machines and
implementation of linear machines to wave energy converters.

Research Experience & Projects
==============================

2011–Present & EU FP7 Project & Marina Platform Project is an EU FP7
project with 17 industrial and academic partners. I am working as a
full-time researcher in the project, which aims to design combined wave
and wind energy platforms. My duty is to compare different generator
topologies and power take-off systems in terms of efficiency and
reliability.\
2013 & United Arab Emirates Uni. & Design of a 5 kW permanent-magnet
linear generator test rig.\
2013 & General Electric & A project to validate the superconducting
generator topology that I developed during my PhD. General Electric
supplied the superconducting coil and test facilities for the cryogenic
tests.\
2011 & NGenTec & Design consultant for a medium-speed generator design.
Electromagnetic optimization a 5 MW, 300 rpm permanent-magnet generator
has been completed.\
2010 & NGenTec & Design and optimization of a 1 MW, 12 rpm direct-drive
generator for a wind turbine. The machine has been manufactured and
successfully tested.\
2010 & SMART R&D Grant & Design and testing of a 25 kW axial flux
permanent-magnet generator. The experimental results have been used to
evaluate the thermal performance of the generator and the cooling
system.\
2010 & Hayward Tyler & Feasibility analysis of a submerged and flooded
permanent-magnet generator. Thermal performance of the flooded generator
has been investigated as well as the corrosion mechanisms and fluid drag
losses.\
2009–2010 & NPower Project & The feasibility analysis of direct-drive PM
generators for two wave energy converters (Aquamarine,AWS Ocean Power)
and two tidal energy converters (Marine Current Turbines,
Scotrenewables) have been investigated. An analytical and optimization
tool is developed, and licensed by University of Edinburgh for further
use.\
2005–2008 & METU & A novel method to estimate the rotor speed and
position of an induction motor using the fringing flux out of the rotor
cage is developed. An international patent has been awarded to this
work.\
