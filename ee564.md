## First Project Topics (Deadline: 19/04):
Here are the options for your first projects:

#### A- Transformer Design for a X-Ray Device:

You are supposed to design a high-frequency, high-voltage transformer that will be used in a X-Ray device. Here are some links to get you familiar with the topic:

- [X-Ray Circuits](https://xraykamarul.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/lecture10.pdf)
- [X-Ray Transformers](http://adammunich.com/x-ray-transformers/)
- [X-Ray Equipment](http://whs.wsd.wednet.edu/faculty/busse/mathhomepage/busseclasses/radiationphysics/lecturenotes/chapter5/chapter5.html)

The specs of the transformer are as follows:

- Single Phase, High Frequency High Voltage Transformer
- Primary Winding Voltage ± 417 V (peak to peak 834 V for pulsing) 
- Secondary Winding Voltage ± 12.5 kV (peak to peak 25 kV for pulsing) 
- Rated Power 30 kW (for maximum 100 millisecond) 
- Switching Frequency Minimum 100 kHz 
- Ambient Temperature 0-40 °C 

#### B- Transformer Design for a HVDC Transmission System:

In a HVDC transmission system, DC/AC + Transformer + AC/DC system is used to step-up the DC voltage to several kV for long range transmission. Here are some links to get you familiar with HVDC Transformers:

- [HVDC Transformes](http://www.electrical-knowhow.com/2012/01/hvdc-transformers.html)
- [Siemens Transformer](http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/transformers/subcommittees/hvdc/F10-DrMarioSchenk-Handout.pdf)
- [ABB Transformer](http://new.abb.com/products/transformers/power/hvdc-converter)

The specs of the transformer that you are going to design are as follows:
 
- 6.5 MVA, Single Phase transformer
- Operating Frequency: 500 Hz
- Input Voltage: 3 kV
- Output Voltage: 300kV
- Operating Temperature 110 °C 


#### C- Eddy Current Brake Design

In this project you are supposed to design an eddy current brake design which will be used as a mechanical damper. Here are some links on the eddy current brakes:

- [Eddy Current Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu1uRvErM80)
- [Eddy Current Brake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddy_current_brake)
- [Eddy Current Brakes](http://www.explainthatstuff.com/eddy-current-brakes.html)
- [Design of Eddy Current Brakes](http://www.tcsme.org/Papers/Vol35/Vol35No1Paper2.pdf)

The eddy current brake has the following specs:

- Outer diameter smaller than 50 mm
- Axial Length shorter than 25 mm
- Required Force: 3 Nm at 1620 rpm
- Required Force: 1 Nm at 900 rpm

You don't have to, but I strongly advise you to use a FEA software (some options are listed above) for this project.


## First Project Guidelines:

You're free to choose any of the projects. Each project has different requirements and outcomes:

### Project outcomes for transformer designs:

The most important parameters are as follows (but not limited to):

- Design specifications of the core (geometry, material, total mass etc)
- Coil dimensions (number of turns, coil dimensions (in AWG), total wire length)
- Efficiency data (copper losses, core losses)
- Electrical parameters (resistance, inductance etc.)
- Comments about you chosen these parameters

### Project outcomes for the eddy current brake:

- Main dimensions (diameter, length, number of poles)
- Basic drawings of the eddy current brake
- Magnet Dimensions (Type, thickness etc)
- Torque vs Speed characteristics (or verification at 900 rpm and 1620 rpm)
- Comments about the design and analysis process


### Notes on Projects

Your reports has to be [reproducible](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261) (i.e. it has to include codes, equations and results in a single document). The results have to be uploaded in an online repository (i.e. [GitHub](https://github.com/)). For that purpose, I personally suggest [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which can be viewed [online](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/). However, you can also use Mathematica, [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) or Matlab Report Generator, but not Microsoft Word. 

If you are convinced to use IPython, here are some useful links:

- Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads), for a quick start on Python.
- Use [Wakari](https://wakari.io), or [Sage](http://sagemath.blogspot.com.tr/2013/09/ipython-notebooks-in-cloud-with.html) to use it online.
- [IPhyton Notebook basics](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/pycon13_ipython.ipynb)
- [A gallery of interesting IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)
- [Reproducible reports with R](http://nicercode.github.io/guides/reports/)

The source files and reports has to be uploaded to the online repository of the course (i.e. [https://github.com/odtu/ee564](https://github.com/odtu/ee564). Have a look at [this link](http://ozan.keysan.me/okst/) for a quick start.

### Projects Grading

**Number of Commits:30%:** The number of edits of your project files as seen from the contributors list. For example, if you start making your project in the last few days, you'll get no credit. If you start early and continue editing your files, you'll get full credit. The project topics are not easy, so this is a way to encourage to start early and work regularly.

**Level of Information:50%:** The detail level of your designs (see requirements above), and the accuracy of your calculations.

**Report Quality:20%:** Text explaining your design decisions, quality of your figures, citing relevant studies and your conclusion section.


<!--
##Second Project Topics

- Main Dimensions (Outer diameter, air-gap diameter, axial-length, number of slots...). Some basic drawings would be perfect.
- Magnetic Circuit Details (flux density calculations at various points: air-gap, teeth, back-core etc, magnetic loading)
- Electric Circuit (Winding selection, electric loading, fill factor, phase resistance, winding factors (if applicable))
- Rough thermal calculations (cooling method, operating temperature, ways to improve cooling)
- Efficiency, current, torque calculations at various load conditions (full-load, half-load, no-load etc)
- Mass Calculations (structural mass, copper mass, steel mass, magnet mass etc)

You must use **at least one software tool** during your design process. Have a look at the [course web-page](http://ozan.keysan.me/ee564/) for some suggestions. Instead of using a software, you can link your analytical design with an optimization algorithm to choose best design parameters.

**Bonus:** Compare the effect of a design parameter on the overall design (i.e. different number of slots, different winding scheme, different aspect ratio etc)

Please visit the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/odtu/ee564) for project topics and design requirements.

## First Project Guidelines:

You're free to choose any of the projects. Each project has different project outcomes:

### 1- Design and manufacture an electric motor (or coil gun, or induction furnace)

Any topology is accepted as long as you built an actual working prototype. The  designs are not supposed to be professional, efficient, commercial-quality products. You can use make-shift components from junkyards etc. Your project will be evaluated in terms of the effort you put in. Project outcomes:

- A few photos showing the design process.
- A video of the working prototype (If you have an YouTube account, please  send me the link, otherwise I'll upload them to internet).
- A 1-2 page of summary that lists the materials used, working principle and the list of things that can be made to improve the performance.

### 2- Simulate the motion of two magnets repelling each other:

You're supposed to simulate the motion of two magnets placed as shown in the figure: 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozank/ozank.github.io/master/presentations/magnet_repelling.png)

You are free to choose the dimensions and the properties of the magnet, but keep them realistic. One of the magnets can be fixed, or both of them can be floating. Don't neglect the gravity.

You don't have to, but I strongly advise you to use a FEA software (some options are listed above). If you don't have experience in FEA software before, [FEMM](http://www.femm.info/wiki/HomePage) is a good start.

Project outcomes:

- Source files of the simulations (not large result files)
- Series of images that has been converted in an animation, or a video (make sure the images include magnetic flux lines, or other useful visuals)
- Graph showing the angular velocity and the linear speed of the magnets versus time.


If you're planning to use FEMM, then the [examples](http://www.femm.info/wiki/Examples) page is very useful. In particular, have a look at these three examples:

- [DC and AC Force of a Gapped EI-Core Inductor](http://www.femm.info/wiki/ACForceExample)
- [Force on a Taper Plunger Magnet](http://www.femm.info/wiki/RotersExample)
- [Coil Gun](http://www.femm.info/wiki/CoilGun)

### 3- Design a junk-yard magnet

You're supposed to design a junk-yard magnet, which is supposed to lift [standard sized metal sheets](http://www.metricmetal.com/product_locator/sheets_and_plates.htm)(you are free to choose which material to work with, but the magnet has to lift any sheet size of that material). The magnet can be energised by any source, but please explain how you obtain the required voltage from the standard 380 V AC supply.

Project outcomes:

- Design specifications of the core (geometry, material, total mass etc)
- Coil dimensions (number of turns, coil dimensions (in AWG), total wire length)
- Efficiency data (copper losses, core losses)
- Electrical parameters (resistance, inductance etc.)
