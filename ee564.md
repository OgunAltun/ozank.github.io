## Third Project Topics (Deadline:15/06)

The main idea of this project is to get you familiar with FEA (finite element analysis) methods. You have the following options:

### A- Modelling Your 2nd Project Designs in FEA

You are supposed to model the induction machines you designed in the 2nd projects. You are free to use any FEA software, but I advise you to use Maxwell. The outputs of the projects are as follows:

- Model your design to RMxprt.
- In the RMxprt get the performance metrics such as: (torque vs. speed, flux in the airgap, cogging torque etc).
- Export your design into Maxwell 2D (don't bother with 3D simulations)
- In 2D FEA show the flux density distribution, flux vectors. Calculate the flux densities in the critical parts (tooth, back core etc)
- Also I expect you to comment on general design considerations that you learnt throughout the course.

### B- Direct-Drive PM Generator Design

If you are tired of designing induction machines, you have another option: to design a direct-drive permanent magnet generator for a wind turbine. Here are the specifications:

- Rated Power: 50 kW, Rated Speed: 60 rpm
- Surface mounted, radial flux type PM generator
- Outer Diameter < 1.5 m
- Total Mass < 1000 kg

### C- BMW i3 Synchronous Reluctance Motor Design

You are supposed to design a synchronous reluctance motror for the [BMW i3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMW_i3), which is a full-electric car with a hybrid-synchronous motor. Although the motor is rated at 75 kW, it can produce instantaneous power up to 125 kW, and torque up to 250 Nm. Although the original motor is PM assisted, you can design a classical synchronous reluctance motor. You are free to use any software, but I personally advise you to use [SYRE](http://sourceforge.net/projects/syr-e/). Here are some useful links:

- [BMW i3](http://www.bmw.com.tr/tr/en/newvehicles/i/i3/2013/showroom/technical_data.html)
- [BMW i3 Torque vs Speed](http://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/i/i3/2013/showroom/drive.html)
- [THE HYBRID-SYNCHRONOUS MACHINE OF THE NEW BMW i3 & i8](http://hybridfordonscentrum.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/20140404_BMW.pdf)
- [Manufacturing of Electric Motor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nJD6b8TL2M)
- [Manufacturing-2](http://insideevs.com/bmw-i3-production-process-videos-batteries-and-drivetrain/)
- [BMW i3 - is this the world's most desirable affordable electric car?](http://www.electric-vehiclenews.com/2014/06/bmw-i3-is-this-worlds-most-desirable.html)
- [Electric traction machine choice](http://sites.ieee.org/miami/files/2014/11/Hendershot-FIU-Lecture.pdf)
- [ABB Synchronous Reluctance Machine](http://www09.abb.com/global/scot/scot201.nsf/veritydisplay/9864acc1853bb0b4c1257de4002e153c/$file/EN_SynRM_Brochure_3AUA00000120962_RevE.pdf)


### Other remarks for the 3rd projects:

- There will NOT be any number of commits grading. Only the technical merits will be graded.
- Please do NOT upload your FEA models to Github. Only upload your figures and reports. I prefer IPython notebooks, but it is ok to use Markdown, Word etc.
- I know Project-B and Project C are more challenging than using the previous induction motor design, but I will grade your project accordingly. Therefore, in project-B and project-C, it is ok to have your designs less detailed compared to project-A.


## Second Project Topics (Deadline:11/05)

2- Prepare a report detailing your design process (just supplying .m files is not accepted). In the report please describe how you decided on the following aspects of the prroject.

- Main Dimensions (Outer diameter, air-gap diameter, axial-length, number of slots...). Please include some basic drawings.

### Notes on Projects

Your reports has to be [reproducible](http://www.nature.com/news/interactive-notebooks-sharing-the-code-1.16261) (i.e. it has to include codes, equations and results in a single document). The results have to be uploaded in an online repository (i.e. [GitHub](https://github.com/)). For that purpose, I personally suggest [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), which can be viewed [online](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/). However, you can also use Mathematica, [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) or Matlab Report Generator, but not Microsoft Word. 

If you are convinced to use IPython, here are some useful links:

- Install [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads), for a quick start on Python.
- Use [Wakari](https://wakari.io), or [Sage](http://sagemath.blogspot.com.tr/2013/09/ipython-notebooks-in-cloud-with.html) to use it online.
- [IPhyton Notebook basics](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Tooblippe/zapycon2013_ipython_science/blob/master/src/pycon13_ipython.ipynb)
- [A gallery of interesting IPython Notebooks](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/A-gallery-of-interesting-IPython-Notebooks)
- [Reproducible reports with R](http://nicercode.github.io/guides/reports/)

The source files and reports has to be uploaded to the online repository of the course (i.e. [https://github.com/odtu/ee564](https://github.com/odtu/ee564). Have a look at [this link](http://ozan.keysan.me/okst/) for a quick start.

### Projects Grading

**Number of Commits:30%:** The number of edits of your project files as seen from the contributors list. For example, if you start making your project in the last few days, you'll get no credit. If you start early and continue editing your files, you'll get full credit. The project topics are not easy, so this is a way to encourage to start early and work regularly.

**Level of Information:50%:** The detail level of your designs (see requirements above), and the accuracy of your calculations.

**Report Quality:20%:** Text explaining your design decisions, quality of your figures, citing relevant studies and your conclusion section.

<!--
## First Project Guidelines:

You're free to choose any of the projects. Each project has different project outcomes:

### 1- Design and manufacture an electric motor (or coil gun, or induction furnace)

Any topology is accepted as long as you built an actual working prototype. The  designs are not supposed to be professional, efficient, commercial-quality products. You can use make-shift components from junkyards etc. Your project will be evaluated in terms of the effort you put in. Project outcomes:

- A few photos showing the design process.
- A video of the working prototype (If you have an YouTube account, please  send me the link, otherwise I'll upload them to internet).
- A 1-2 page of summary that lists the materials used, working principle and the list of things that can be made to improve the performance.

### 2- Simulate the motion of two magnets repelling each other:

You're supposed to simulate the motion of two magnets placed as shown in the figure: 

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ozank/ozank.github.io/master/presentations/magnet_repelling.png)

You are free to choose the dimensions and the properties of the magnet, but keep them realistic. One of the magnets can be fixed, or both of them can be floating. Don't neglect the gravity.

You don't have to, but I strongly advise you to use a FEA software (some options are listed above). If you don't have experience in FEA software before, [FEMM](http://www.femm.info/wiki/HomePage) is a good start.

Project outcomes:

- Source files of the simulations (not large result files)
- Series of images that has been converted in an animation, or a video (make sure the images include magnetic flux lines, or other useful visuals)
- Graph showing the angular velocity and the linear speed of the magnets versus time.


If you're planning to use FEMM, then the [examples](http://www.femm.info/wiki/Examples) page is very useful. In particular, have a look at these three examples:

- [DC and AC Force of a Gapped EI-Core Inductor](http://www.femm.info/wiki/ACForceExample)
- [Force on a Taper Plunger Magnet](http://www.femm.info/wiki/RotersExample)
- [Coil Gun](http://www.femm.info/wiki/CoilGun)

### 3- Design a junk-yard magnet

You're supposed to design a junk-yard magnet, which is supposed to lift [standard sized metal sheets](http://www.metricmetal.com/product_locator/sheets_and_plates.htm)(you are free to choose which material to work with, but the magnet has to lift any sheet size of that material). The magnet can be energised by any source, but please explain how you obtain the required voltage from the standard 380 V AC supply.

Project outcomes:

- Design specifications of the core (geometry, material, total mass etc)
- Coil dimensions (number of turns, coil dimensions (in AWG), total wire length)
- Efficiency data (copper losses, core losses)
- Electrical parameters (resistance, inductance etc.)
