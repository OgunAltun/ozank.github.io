## Open Reference Letters

This page is for my open reference letters that I write for students that I trust and recommend most. Students can request a closed reference letter for their university and job applications, but they can NOT request to be listed in this page. I choose only one or two best students every year, and publish their reference letters here, as I am proud with their work and no hesitation in recommending them.
