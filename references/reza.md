### Reference Letter for Reza Zeinali

### 15/01/2017

To whom it may concern,

This reference letter is provided at the request of Mr. Reza Zeinali for his PhD application in the EPFL. Reza got his MSc from Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department of Middle East Technical University a few months ago. I was not his MSc supervisor, but I know Reza for two years and we shared the same research group's office and also worked together in a research project. 

His MSc topic was on “Design and Optimization of High Torque Density Generator for Direct Drive Wind Turbine”, he worked on PM-Vernier machines, which are quite unconventional and novel machines that utilize magnetic gearing effect. He extensively used FEA tools (ANSYS Maxwell) as well as genetic algorithm optimization methods by using MATLAB toolbox. He designed a 50 kW novel PM machine, which can be 30% lighter than conventional radial flux PM machines. Reza got a full scholarship (tuition fee waiver and living expenses) from METU as a top graduate student.

Last year, I had chance to work together with Reza in an industry funded project on designing of PM motors for high performance avionic servo systems. Reza successfully evaluated different types of PM motors (slotted, surface-mount, coreless, fractional slot etc.) and made a comparison of all these types of motors. Later, he designed different versions of motors for the servo drive system considering the mass, cost, efficiency and thermal constraints. He built FEA models for the motors and validated his analytical designs. The motors are in production now, and Reza is still working together with the company, thus increasing his knowledge on the manufacturing of electrical machines. Based on the topics he worked in his MSc and in the project, I am sure that he has enough knowledge to successfully complete any project in the Electrical Engineering and Power Engineering area. At the moment, we are working on a special direct-drive superconducting machine, in which he applied his knowledge in the field, and came up with a few very novel and interesting machine topologies. One of these ideas now has been submitted to a special session of IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics.

He is a very organized, problem-solver type of person and has the analytical skills to work independently and be successful in a PhD project. He get along very well with his skills and he will be a very efficient team member and hard-working and determined student and has the analytical skills to success in challenging research projects. He is also very good at teaching and presenting, not only he gave regular seminars in our research group, but also he gave a four-week (16 hours) workshop ([http://power.eee.metu.edu.tr/maxwell-training/](http://power.eee.metu.edu.tr/maxwell-training/)) in our research group on Finite Element Analysis and Optimization of Electrical Machines.  

I therefore strongly recommend Mr. Reza Zeinali to be accepted to the PhD program in EPFL. Based on my personal experience, I believe that he will be very successful researcher in his field. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further questions.

Yours Sincerely,

Dr. Ozan Keysan
