### Reference Letter for Hakan Polat

### 16/12/2020


To whom it may concern,

This reference letter is provided at the request of Mr Hakan Polat for his PhD application. Hakan got his BSc from Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department of METU in 2018, with a CGPA of 3.39/4.00. It should be noted that our department accepts only the top 0.1% students from Turkey to its undergraduate programs. Last year, among more than 1.8 million applicants of the university entrance exam, only 200 students in the top 2000 had been accepted to the BSc program of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department. Furthermore, our department has been evaluated among the worldâ€™s best 200 Electrical-Electronics Engineering Departments in the world in QS ([more information](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2019/engineering-electrical-electronic)). .

I know Hakan for over three years from several undergraduate classes and as his MSc supervisor.  He got grades of BB, AA, and AA from these three undergraduate courses. From all these three courses, I remember him being a keen student and interested in power electronics topics. Hakan was always attentive in the classes and an excellent listener. Hakan is an active member of our research group [PowerLab](http://power.eee.metu.edu.tr) since 2018. He worked on a project on finite-element modeling of electromagnetic launchers (rail-guns) for one year.  During the project, he worked on a 2 MJ electromagnetic launcher. He  designed and optimized rail and armature geometries. He used COMSOL software for electromagnetic, thermal and mechanical FEA analyses. Although these multi-physics simulations are quite challenging, Hakan had efficiently overcame those issues by his analytical knowledge in electromagnetics and practical knowledge in FEA analysis techniques. I am sure he will have no problem at any electromagnetic design problem he can face in his PhD dissertation. He contributed to the publication of three journal papers (IEEE Transactions) and one conference paper from this project just in one year.

After the completion of the rail-gun project, Hakan started working on a research project on the design of a modular and fault-tolerant wireless power transfer system for synchronous electrical machines. I should emphasize that Hakan came up with this idea, wrote the research proposal and made the grant application just by himself. Therefore, he is a very self-sufficient, responsible and productive team member. In this research project, he designed a 1 kW, 150 kHz wireless power transfer system. He made the analytical calculations, LTSpice & Matlab simulations, finite-element analyses for the coils, designed the PCB layout, assembled circuit components, completed the experiments successfully. He is also leading two graduate students in the same projects proving his capacity as a leader and efficient team member. Hakan is now in the process of writing journal papers from this project (two of them are under review, and another two is being prepared).  In summary, in his Msc, he successfully completed all the aspects of a research project starting from writing the project proposal to experimental validation and publishing academic journals.

He just became a teaching assistant in our department. I am sure his new position will improve his skills in teaching. I am sure he will not have any problems as his communication skills are excellent and he likes to share his knowledge with other people. He is responsible for teaching 3rd-year [electromechanical energy conversion](http://keysan.me/ee361) and 4th year undergraduate [power electronics](http://keysan.me/ee463)  courses. 

Based on my personal experience, I believe that Hakan will be a very productive graduate student, and he has the right skills and background to be successful in new challenges. I therefore strongly recommend Hakan Polat in his PhD application. If I can provide you with any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours Sincerely,
