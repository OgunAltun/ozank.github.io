### Reference Letter for Furkan Karakaya

### 17/11/2020

To whom it may concern,

This reference letter is provided at the request of Mr. Furkan Karakaya for his PhD application. Furkan got his BSc from Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department of METU in 2017, with an CGPA of 3.61 of 4.00. It should be noted that our department accepts only top %0.1 students from Turkey to its undergraduate programs. Last year, among more than 1.8 million applicants of the university entrance exam, only 200 students in the top 2000 have been accepted to the BSc program of Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department. Furthermore, our department has been evaluated among the worldâ€™s best 200 Electrical-Electronics Engineering Departments in the world in QS ([more information](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2019/engineering-electrical-electronic)). 

I know Furkan for over five years from several undergraduate classes and as his MSc supervisor.   He became an active member of our research group [PowerLab](http://power.eee.metu.edu.tr) in 2016. Furkan is always curious and like challenging problems and push his limits further by improving his knowledge in every aspects of his research interests. Furkan is really quick in learning new concepts, and combining his theoretical background with practical concepts. He first joined as a researcher to a project called "Design of a 8 kW Integrated Modular Motor Drive with GaN transistors", in which he improved his knowledge both in power electronics hardware and also in electric motor design and control techniques. He contributed to the project by designing complex PCB circuits for the 2 kW GaN inverter and also working on the switching characteristics of the GaN transistors. He has the experience and dedication to design, improve, implement the designs and also verify these designs without external guidance with confidence. 

He always has the motivation to learn new things and works independently. In order to improve his skills, he completed a seven course online MSc program on [Power Electronics on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/power-electronics) instructed by Prof. Robert Erickson on top of his normal course load in METU. He the got accepted to a three months summer fellowship in EPFL with Prof. Elison Matioli. He managed to contribute to [three journal papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nVV7vLwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) in his short visit to EPFL. I have to emphasize that all these were possible thanks to determination and initiative of Furkan.

He completed his MSc in 2020. In his thesis, he designed a high power density bi-directional DC/DC converter with parallel connected GaN switches. He investigated all aspects of the converter, including switch characterization, PCB layout design,  FEA modelling, analytical modeling, novel short-circuit protection for parallel connected GaNs. The quality of his work went well beyond expectations of a MSc thesis. The submitted a journal paper for his novel layout based short circuit protections, and he is in the process of submitting other papers.

Furkan is a real team player, and likes to help to the other people in our research group. He likes to share his knowledge, in the recent years he organized journal clubs, seminars, gave tutorials. After completing his MSc study, he is now participating different projects to expand his knowledge. He is now designing GaN drive and control cards for a integrated PCB motor, and motor drive systems for a five-phase axial flux PM motor. He is also helping me to set up a new laboratory specialized in PV inverters. His knowledge in measurement equipment is immense. He likes to follow the latest trends and likes to learn new software.

He also has a teaching assistant position in METU since 2019. Since then, he channeled his skills to improve the undergraduate classes and laboratories. He is the coordinator for 4th year undergraduate [power electronics course](https://github.com/odtu/ee463), in which he led the software and hardware project assignments and put lots of effort to improve the experiments and laboratory manual. His communication with students are always excellent and he gets nice feedback from undergraduate students in the course evaluation forms.   

He is a very organized, problem-solver type of person and has the analytical skills to work independently and be successful in a PhD project. I am sure he will be a very dedicated and responsible team member and has the analytical skills to success in challenging research projects. He is also very good at teaching, presenting and sharing his knowledge with other team members. I therefore strongly recommend Mr. Furkan Karakaya to be accepted to the PhD program. Based on my personal experience, I believe that he will be very successful researcher in his field. Please do not hesitate to contact me for further questions.

Yours Sincerely,

Dr. Ozan Keysan
