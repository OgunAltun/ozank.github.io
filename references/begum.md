### Reference Letter for Begüm Kabagöz

### 12/12/2016

To whom it may concern,

This reference letter is provided at the request of Ms. Begum Kabagoz for her graduate admission to UCSD. Begum will get her BSc from Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department of Middle East Technical University (METU) in June 2017. She is also doing a double major in Physics in the same university. As you can see from her transcripts she managed to get high honors from both programs. I like to mention that METU accepts students to its undergraduate programs according to the results of a nationwide University Entrance Examination. Last year, among more than 1.5 million applicants, only 200 students in the top 2000 have been accepted to the B.Sc Program of our Department. Furthermore, our department has been evaluated among the world’s best 100 Electrical-Electronics Engineering Departments in the world in different rankings systems ([more information](http://eee2.metu.edu.tr/discover-metu-eee)). 

I know Begum for one and half year and I feel very lucky to have met with Begum as her lecturer and to have worked together with her in a few research projects. She is an active member of our research group [PowerLab](http://power.eee.metu.edu.tr/people/) in METU. Begum attended two undergraduate 3rd year lectures in my class. Not only she scored the highest grades in the exams, but also she seated every lecture in the very first row, with impressive participation in the class. She was always a very good listener and I could see her analytical skills in her to the point questions. Last year she joined the [STAR projects](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/) program that aims to get undergraduate students participated in research projects with faculty members. The students volunteer to join in research projects without any obligation. Begum participated actually in two projects. The first one is about modeling a coil gun launcher system using FEA (finite element analysis) software. Begum learned how to use ANSYS Maxwell in a remarkably short amount time, which shows her determination and learning skills. She participated in an undergraduate research workshop and made a poster presentation. Later on, she used her FEA simulation skills to help a MSc student to model the core losses and flux density distribution in a planar transformer that will be used in a LLC type resonant converter. She prepared a design report, which supplied great information for the MSc project. Now, we are working on a journal paper in IEEE Transactions, in which Begum will be a co-author for her work in the project.

Begum also helped to build a experiment set-up that is used in the Photonics Laboratory of our department. The set-up demonstrates the Faraday effect (i.e. change in the polarization angle with external magnetic field due to a current carrying conductor). The setup will be also used as a test bench for a research project on optical current measurement transformer for the HV transmission lines. Begum determined all the required materials, contacted with the suppliers and organized the road-map for the laboratory setup. These things clearly show that Begum is a very responsible person and a researcher with capability to work independently. She has a clear vision on practical aspects of a project, as well as the required theoretical background.

I therefore strongly recommend Ms. Begum Kabagoz for a PhD inUCSD. Based on my personal experience, I believe that she will be a very successful researcher in her field. If I can provide you with any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours Sincerely,

Dr. Ozan Keysan
