### Reference Letter for A. Melisa Sarıcı

### 30/11/2017

To whom it may concern,

This reference letter is provided at the request of Ms. Melisa Sarıcı for her graduate program application. Melisa will get her BSc from Electrical and Electronics Engineering Department of Middle East Technical University (METU) in June 2018, with an estimated GPA of 3.92 of 4.00. I would like to mention here that METU only accepts top students from Turkey to its undergraduate programs. Last year, among more than 1.5 million applicants of the university entrance exam, only 200 students in the top 2000 have been accepted to the B.Sc Program of Electrical-Electronics Engineering Department. Furthermore, our department has been evaluated among the world’s best 100 Electrical-Electronics Engineering Departments in the world in different rankings systems ([more information](http://eee2.metu.edu.tr/discover-metu-eee)). 

I know Melisa for over one year from three undergraduate classes she got from me, needless to say that she got the highest grades from all of these courses. She was always a very good listener and asks any points in the class that is not clear to her, which proves her curiosity and interest in the topic. She became an active member of our research group [PowerLab](http://power.eee.metu.edu.tr/people/) in METU, after she joined the [STAR projects](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/); a program that aims to get undergraduate students participated in research projects with faculty members. The students volunteer to join in research projects without any obligation. Melisa started with MATLAB/Simulink modeling of a DC motor drive system and implementation of it using TI DSP boards. At the moment, she is working on a integrated modular motor drive project, in which she focuses on modeling of novel GaN transistors. Melisa is really quick in learning new concepts, and combining her theoretical background with practical concepts. Her very strong background of mathematics and high level of determination let her crack every difficult challenges. She is a regular member of our weekly research group meetings and journal clubs. Every week she presents weekly progress reports, all of which are very professionally prepared. Now, we are working on a journal paper with her and one of my PhD students, and she will be a co-author for her work in GaN modeling and computer simulations.

Melisa has all the aspects of a successful researcher, as well as being a independent in research projects, she performs well in a team and contributes for the overall aim of the team. She has a clear vision on practical aspects of a project, as well as the required theoretical background. She keeps a track of projects in her [GitHub page](https://github.com/MelisaSarici), by investigating that page, it is easy to identify the high quality of her projects. 

I therefore strongly recommend Ms. Melisa Sarıcı as a graduate student. Based on my personal experience, I believe that she will be a very successful researcher in her field. If I can provide you with any further information, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours Sincerely,

Dr. Ozan Keysan
