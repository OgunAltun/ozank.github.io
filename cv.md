## Research Interests

My main area of interests are renewable energy, design of electric machines, and power electronics. In particular, I am working on novel drive-train concepts for wind energy such as high-temperature superconducting machines and direct-drive generators. I am also interested in modular and fault-tolerant electrical machines.

## Research Experience & Projects

For more details please visit the [My Projects](/projects) page.

|2017| ASELSAN MW Wind Turbine| Feasibility analysis and design of a MW sized direct-drive wind turbine generator.|
|2016-2017| ASELSAN Rail-Gun Project| Electromagnetic Design and Optimization of a 200kJ-2MJ Electromagnetic Launcher.|

|2011–2014 | EU FP7 Project | Marina Platform Project is an EU FP7 project with 17 industrial and academic partners. I am working as a full-time researcher in the project, which aims to design combined wave and wind energy platforms. My duty is to compare different generator topologies and power take-off systems in terms of efficiency and reliability.|
|2013 | United Arab Emirates Uni. | Design of a 5 kW permanent-magnet linear generator test rig.|
|2013 | [GE Power Conversion](http://www.gepowerconversion.com/) | A project to validate the superconducting generator topology that I developed during my PhD. General Electric supplied the superconducting coil and test facilities for the cryogenic tests.|
|2011 | [NGenTec](http://www.ngentec.com/) | Design consultant for a medium-speed generator design. Electromagnetic optimization a 5 MW, 300 rpm permanent-magnet generator has been completed.|

|2010 | SMART R&D Grant | Design and testing of a 25 kW axial flux permanent-magnet generator. The experimental results have been used to evaluate the thermal performance of the generator and the cooling system.|
|2010 | [Hayward Tyler](http://www.haywardtyler.com/) | Feasibility analysis of a submerged and flooded permanent-magnet generator. Thermal performance of the flooded generator has been investigated as well as the corrosion mechanisms and fluid drag losses.|
|2009–2010 | NPower Project | The feasibility analysis of direct-drive PM generators for two wave energy converters ([Aquamarine Power](http://www.aquamarinepower.com/),[AWS Ocean Power](http://www.awsocean.com)) and two tidal energy converters ([Marine Current Turbines](http://www.marineturbines.com/), [Scotrenewables](http://www.scotrenewables.com/)) have been investigated. An analytical and optimization tool is developed, and licensed by University of Edinburgh for further use.|
