## Research Interests

My main area of interest is in the design and development of electrical
machines. In particular, I am working on novel machine topologies such
as superconducting machines and permanent-magnet machines. I also worked
on the structural and thermal analysis of electrical machines and
implementation of linear machines to wave energy converters.

## Research Experience & Projects

|2011–Present | EU FP7 Project | [Marina Platform](http://www.marina-platform.info/) Project is an EU FP7 project with 17 industrial and academic partners. I am working as a full-time researcher in the project, which aims to design combined wave and wind energy platforms. My duty is to compare different generator topologies and power take-off systems in terms of efficiency and reliability.|
|2013 | United Arab Emirates Uni. | Design of a 5 kW permanent-magnet linear generator test rig.|
|2013 | [GE Power Conversion](http://www.gepowerconversion.com/) | A project to validate the superconducting generator topology that I developed during my PhD. General Electric supplied the superconducting coil and test facilities for the cryogenic tests.|
|2011 | [NGenTec](http://www.ngentec.com/) | Design consultant for a medium-speed generator design. Electromagnetic optimization a 5 MW, 300 rpm permanent-magnet generator has been completed.|
|2010 | [NGenTec](http://www.ngentec.com/) | Design and optimization of a 1 MW, 12 rpm direct-drive generator for a wind turbine. The machine has been manufactured and successfully tested.|
|2010 | SMART R&D Grant | Design and testing of a 25 kW axial flux permanent-magnet generator. The experimental results have been used to evaluate the thermal performance of the generator and the cooling system.|
|2010 | [Hayward Tyler](http://www.haywardtyler.com/) | Feasibility analysis of a submerged and flooded permanent-magnet generator. Thermal performance of the flooded generator has been investigated as well as the corrosion mechanisms and fluid drag losses.|
|2009–2010 | NPower Project | The feasibility analysis of direct-drive PM generators for two wave energy converters ([Aquamarine Power](http://www.aquamarinepower.com/),[AWS Ocean Power](http://www.awsocean.com)) and two tidal energy converters ([Marine Current Turbines](http://www.marineturbines.com/), [Scotrenewables](http://www.scotrenewables.com/)) have been investigated. An analytical and optimization tool is developed, and licensed by University of Edinburgh for further use.|
|2005–2008 | METU | A novel method to estimate the rotor speed and position of an induction motor using the fringing flux out of the rotor cage is developed. An international patent has been awarded to this work.|
