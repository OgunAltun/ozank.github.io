1-Learn how to use Github (https://github.com/)
First open an account and please email me your username, and you can check my account (https://github.com/ozank )
Github seems confusing at first, but trust me, you'll thank me a few years later. YOu can start with the following links:

    SourceTree
    GitHub Windows

    Atlassian Tutorial
    Git for beginners
    Git Tutorial
    Git Beginner Tutorial

I ask my postgraduate students to share all of their data in GitHub so I can track their progress, here are a few students from our research group:

https://github.com/ErencanDuymaz

https://github.com/mesutto

2- Install Mendeley ( https://www.mendeley.com )

Mendeley is the main tool in our research group to discuss the journals. Once you install it please let me know your username, and I'll sen you an invitation to join to our research group.

In the meantime, you can transfer your existing literature to Mendeley

3-Install Simulink

I remember you already know how to use Simulink, but make sure you have the SimScape and the SimPower systems installed in your system. Simulink has lots of nice tutorials, please complete as many as you like until you got very familiar with the software

4-Motor Control Tutorials

One you start your MSc I like to work on the wind turbine simulator we have in the lab (photo attached). It's a 10 kW simulator and we have a 30kW PV system. You can start with simulating synthetic inertia with hybrid PV (and maybe battery storage system)

But before starting on that, can you complete the tutorials in the following link:

http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=MotorSpeed&section=SystemModeling

Just try to complete them in Matlab and upload your models to github regularly. If you have any problems don't hesitate to ask me.
